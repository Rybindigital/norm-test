# Environment variables and secrets

You can configure environment variables and secrets in your project, such as settings for your project or access tokens for APIs.

### Project-level environment variables and secrets

Currently, CodeSandbox Repositories only support **project-level** configuration. The secrets and environment variables are shared across all VMs, but you need to restart your workspace after making changes for them to take effect.

### Storage and Encryption

Environment variables are stored in our database, AES-encrypted. The encryption key is rerolled from time to time on an unannounced schedule and it is stored separately from the database.

### Privacy

Environment variables are enabled only for **private** repositories and they are only viewable by users with write access to the repository.



## Setting env variables and secrets
### From the UI

1. Open your project in the Web Editor.
2. Open the **Menu** through the icon in the top left corner.
